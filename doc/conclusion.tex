\section{Conclusion}
What does my code do, what problems arose, what problems persist, what does my code cannot do, where are opportunities for extensions, etc.
 \subsection{Future Work}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Now: Only forces at nodes are accepted and processed. Then: Pressures linked to faces can be accepted, too. The conversion to nodal values takes place in the structure solver. (Idea from coupling data mapping)
  \end{itemize}
